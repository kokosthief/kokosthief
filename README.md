# Curious Web3 Developer in Training ðŸ¤–

Hi, I'm a developer based in Europe. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹
I have a tonne of interests and come from a more creative background and marketing, but diving deep into coding as it really fits who I am, and allows me to build and contribute on cool projects within Crypto.

I love learning new things, so here I'll document my learning process as I update my repos. 

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrywillmott/) [Telegram](https://t.me/kokosthief) or by [Email](mailto:hello@hrwillmott.com).
