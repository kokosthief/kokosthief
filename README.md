# Curious Web3 Developer in Training ðŸ¤–

Hi, I'm self-taught a web developer based in Europe.

I have a tonne of interest in techn and all things crypto. I come from a creative background and after getting the coding bug feel happy diving deep into developing my tech stach as a web dev working within Web3 and crypto.

I love coding as it really fits who I am and allows me to get on board with cool projects.

I love learning new things, so here I'll document my learning process as I update my repos. 

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrywillmott/), [Telegram](https://t.me/kokosthief) or by [Email](mailto:hello@hrwillmott.com).
